    abstract = {{This book builds theoretical statistics from the first
		  principles of probability theory. Starting from the basics
		  of probability, the authors develop the theory of
		  statistical inference using techniques, definitions, and
		  concepts that are statistical and are natural extensions
		  and consequences of previous concepts. Intended for
		  first-year graduate students, this book can be used for
		  students majoring in statistics who have a solid
		  mathematics background. It can also be used in a way that
		  stresses the more practical uses of statistical theory,
		  being more concerned with understanding basic statistical
		  concepts and deriving reasonable statistical procedures for
		  a variety of situations, and less concerned with formal
		  optimality investigations.}},
